http://trondn.blogspot.com/2010/10/writing-your-own-storage-engine-for.html

- fetch memcached source code, engine-pu branch: https://github.com/memcached/memcached/tree/engine-pu
$ ./confih/autorun.sh
$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/memcached
$ make all install
$ /opt/memcached/bin/memcached -E /opt//memcached/lib/memcached/default_engine.so

in a different term:

$ memcapable

All tests should pass. your memcached is ok and can switch backends. Now for fs_engine:

$ cd memcached_fs_engine
$ make clean all
$ /opt/memcached/bin/memcached -E fs_engine.so

in a different term

$ memcapable

currently get and set (store and get internally) are working.
data is stored at /tmp/memcached_fs_storage
